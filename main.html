                    Welcome to my basic outline for my future portfolio.  Here on this page
                    I will go over a bit about myself and my background.  I will briefly touch on the
                    skills that I have acquired over my life.  What makes me a valuable prospective
                    employee.  Possibly have a picture and or headshot.  I will also talk about some of
                    the challenges I have faced and overcome while breaking into the IT field.
